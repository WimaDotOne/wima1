#Not so long ago... In the mysterious land... of Toronto, Canada... Scott Pilgrim was dating a high schooler
KIM: Scott Pilgrim is dating a high schooler?

[m2.jpg
STEPHEN: Really? Is she hot?
KIM: How old are you now, Scott? Like 28?
SCOTT: I'm not playing your little games, kids
KIM: So, you've been out of high school for, like, 13 years
SCOTT: I'm 22.
STEPHEN: And you're dating a high-school girl. Not bad, not bad.
SCOTT: Thank you, thank you. We almost held hands once, but then she got embarrassed.
KIM: Well, aren't you pleased as punch.
SCOTT: I don't know what you're talking about.
STEPHEN: So what's her name?
SCOTT: Knives Chau. She's Chinese.
NEIL: Wicked.
STEPHEN: So, when do we get to meet her?
KIM: Oh please, let it be soon.

SCOTT: Seriously, please be good.
KNIVES: Am I normally not?

SCOTT: Hey, Knives, this is Stephen Stills. He's the talent.
STEPHEN: Hey.

#Stephen shuts the door in Knives' face
STEPHEN: Is she gonna geek out on us?
SCOTT: She'll just sit in the corner, man.
STEPHEN: I mean, I want her to geek out on us.
SCOTT: She'll geek. She geeks. She has the capacity to geek.
STEPHEN: Okay.

#Knives was stunned to see a band. Scott warmly takes Knives' coat but coolly drops it on the floor. Kim does not like Knives a bit.
KNIVES: Wow.
SCOTT: Here, let me get your coat. Knives, that's Kim.
KNIVES: Sorry, what was your name?
KIM: Kim.
KNIVES: And you play the drums?
KIM: Yes.
KNIVES: That is so awesome.
---
[m8.jpg
#Knives thought Neil was a member of the band.
SCOTT: Knives, that's Neil.
NEIL: Hi.
KNIVES: Hi. What do you play?
NEIL: Wow, Zelda, Tetris. That's kind of a big question.

[m9.jpg
SCOTT: Okay, let's start with Launchpad McQuack.
STEPHEN: That's not the actual title of the...
KIM: We are Sex Bob-Omb. One! Two! Three!  Four...

#Rock music playing
KIM: You guys are so amazing.

[m11.jpg
STEPHEN: She seems nice.
SCOTT: Yeah.
NEIL: Yeah, she seems awesome.
SCOTT: Yeah.
---
[m12.jpg
KIM: Scott, if your life had a face, I would punch it.
SCOTT: Yeah. Wait, what?
KIM: I mean, are you really happy or are you really evil?
SCOTT: Like, do I have ulterior motives or something? I'm offended, Kim.
KIM: Wounded, even?
SCOTT: Hurt, Kim.
KIM: You? Hurt?

[m13.jpg
SCOTT: Neil, you were saying about "she seems awesome."
Neil: Yeah, she seems awesome.
SCOTT: Yeah.

#Afterwards in Scott's apartment with his roomate
SCOTT: Before you hear some dirty lies from someone else, yes, I'm dating a 17-year-old. So, the whole 17-year-old thing, don't tell too many people.

[m15.jpg
#Wallace text scott's sister
WALLACE: Hey, you know me.
SCOTT: I mean, don't tell my sister.
WALLACE: You know me.
SCOTT: Who are you texting?
---
[m16.jpg
#Phone rings. Scott's sister calls.
STACEY: Seventeen years old? Scandal!
SCOTT: That's not true. Who told you?
STACEY: Wallace. Duh.
SCOTT: That gossipy bitch.
WALLACE: You know me.
STACEY: Who is this mystery child you date?
SCOTT: Her name's Knives Chau. She's Chinese.
STACEY: A 17-year-old Chinese schoolgirl? You're ridiculous. 
---
[m17.jpg
STACEY:Scott, why are you doing this?
SCOTT: I don't know. It's just nice, you know? It's just simple.
STACEY: It's been over a year since you got dumped by She-Who-Will-Not-Be-Named. So... Are you legitimately moving on or is this just you being insane?
SCOTT: Can I get back to you on that?
===
---
[m18.jpg
#School bell rings
WALLACE: I do not wanna be here at all.
SCOTT: This school has boys, too.
Wallace: I hate you. Even I would think twice about dating a 17-year-old.
SCOTT: Well, she's only allowed out when the sun is up, so I wouldn't call it dating.
---
[m19.jpg
KNIVES: Scott!
SCOTT: Hey, Knives! This is my cool, gay roommate, Wallace Wells.
KNIVES: Hi.
SCOTT: He's gay.
KNIVES: Oh, do you wanna know who in my class is gay?
WALLACE: Yes, does he wear glasses?
---
[m20.jpg
SCOTT: Wallace, you go now. Begone.
WALLACE: You're too good for him. Run.
===
---
[m21.jpg
SCOTT: Did you know that the original name for Pac-Man was Puck-Man? You'd think it was because he looks like a hockey puck, but it actually comes from the Japanese phrase "paku-paku," which means, "to flap one's mouth open and closed." They changed it because they thought that "Puck-Man" would be too easy to vandalize. You know, people could just scratch off the "P" and turn it into an "F" or whatever.
---
[m22.jpg
KNIVES: Oh, my God! Like, wow!
SCOTT: Yeah. Wow.
---
[m23.jpg
#Game is over. Scott hints to Knives that she needs to buy more coins to continue the game.
KNIVES: Oh, I got it.

[m24.jpg
#At Goodwill store
KNIVES: I don't listen to that much music. I mean, I know a lot of kids who play piano or whatever, but you guys... You guys rock.
SCOTT: Well, I knew I personally rocked, but I never suspected that we rocked as a unit. So thank you, Knives.
---
[m25.jpg
KNIVES: I mean, you guys are gonna be huge.
SCOTT: Well, we're already pretty big, but, yeah, I guess it'd be cool, if cool people started wearing our T-shirt or whatever.
KNIVES: Cool.
SCOTT: Yeah yeah.
---
[m26.jpg
KNIVES: Excuse me, do you have anything by The Clash at Demonhead?
JULIE: Have you tried the section marked "The Clash at Demonhead"?
SCOTT: Thank you, Julie.
JULIE: Are you coming to my party Friday, or will you be busy babysitting?
---
[m27.jpg
SCOTT: Thank you, Julie. You don't want to listen to her.
---
[m28.jpg
SCOTT: And you definitely don't want to listen to them.
KNIVES: Oh, I heart them so much.
SCOTT: Yeah, I hearted them, too, until they signed to a major label, and the lead singer turned into a total bitch and ruined my life forever. But that's just me.
KNIVES: Envy Adams is so cool. Do you read her blog?
SCOTT: Sorry, you were saying about me?
===
---
[m29.jpg
KNIVES: I mean, I've never gone out with anyone so talented.
SCOTT: Go out with a lot of guys?
KNIVES: No.
SCOTT: Yeah, so, whatever, man.
KNIVES: I've never even kissed a guy.
SCOTT: Hey, me, neither.
---
[m30.jpg

---
[m31.jpg
SCOTT: Here you go. 
KNIVES: So this is your secret lair? 
SCOTT: Yeah, yeah.
KNIVES: Can I come in?
SCOTT: My secret lair is one of those "No girls allowed"-type deals.
KNIVES: Okay.
SCOTT: But do you wanna see the house where I grew up?
KNIVES: Sure!
SCOTT: Come on.

#In Scott's dream
SCOTT: So alone.
RAMONA: You are not alone.
SCOTT: What?
RAMONA: You are just having some idiotic dream.
SCOTT: Does that mean we can make out?
---
[m34.jpg
SCOTT: Oh, God! I had this totally weird dream. There was this girl.
WALLACE: Weren't you supposed to take your fake high-school girlfriend to the library a half-hour ago?
---
[m35.jpg
#In library
SCOTT: It's weird.
KNIVES: What's weird?
SCOTT: Libraries remind me of grade school.
KNIVES: That must seem like a really long time ago.
SCOTT: Yeah, let's talk about something else.

[m37.jpg

[m38.jpg
KNIVES: Do you know that girl?

[m39.jpg
SCOTT: Sorry, what are we doing?
STEPHEN: I told you, like, 50 times!
KIM: We're going to this party, retard.
SCOTT: Party?
NEIL: At Julie's.
SCOTT: Ah. I thought you guys split up.
STEPHEN: We did, but there might be some label guys there, so, you know...
SCOTT: Oh, man, this is gonna suck.
KIM: At least it'll give us something to complain about.
SCOTT: Oh, man.

NEIL: Sucks!

COMEAU: Scott! Hey!
SCOTT: Hey, Comeau.
COMEAU: How about this party? You getting your drink on here?
SCOTT: No, I don't drink. This is just Coke Zero.
COMEAU: What do you mean, you don't drink? I distinctly remember you being very drunk off a couple of G-and-T's...
SCOTT: Hey, Comeau, you know everyone, right?
COMEAU: Yeah, pretty much, I do.
---
[m42.jpg
SCOTT: You know this one girl with hair like this?

[m48.jpg
SCOTT: Hey, what's up?
RAMONA: Nothing.
SCOTT: Hey, you know Pac-Man?
RAMONA: I know of him.
SCOTT: Well, Pac-Man was originallly called Puck-Man. They changed it because... Not because Pac-Man looks like a hockey puck. "Paku-paku" means "flap your mouth," and that they were afraid people would change... Scratch out the "P" and turn it into an "F," like... (Chuckles nervously)
RAMONA: Yeah, that's amazing.

[m49.jpg
SCOTT: Um... Am I dreaming?
RAMONA:
SCOTT: I'll leave you alone forever now.

SCOTT: Dude! What do you know about Ramona Flowers?
COMEAU: All I know is that she is American.
SCOTT: American.
COMEAU: Why don't you go talk to Sandra and Monique? They know a lot about her.
---
[m56.jpg
SCOTT: Lady-dudes. What do you know about Ramona Flowers?
SANDRA: I heard she has a boyfriend.
MONIQUE: Yeah. Some guy back in New York.
SCOTT: Yeah, yeah, yeah. What else?

I heard she kicks all kinds of ass.

JULIE: What about Ramona Flowers?
SCOTT: You know her? Tell me now.
JULIE: She just moved here. Got a job at Amazon. Comes into my work.
SCOTT: Does she really?
---
[m62.jpg
STEPHEN: Didn't you say she just broke up with someone?
SCOTT: Did she really?
STEPHEN: They had a huge fight, or whatever.
SCOTT: Did they really?
JULIE: Yes! But I didn't want Scott to know that, Stephen.
SCOTT: Yeah, I don't know what it is about that girl.
JULIE: Scott, I forbid you from hitting on Ramona, even if you haven't had a real girlfriend in over a year.
STEPHEN: Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Scott's mourning period is officially over. He's totally dating a high-schooler.
JULIE: Dating a high-schooler is the mourning period.
---
[m63.jpg
STEPHEN: She's got a point.
SCOTT: I thought you guys broke up.
JULIE: I don't want you scaring off the coolest girl at my party, Scott. We all know you're a total lady-killer wannabe, jerky-jerk.
SCOTT: That's completely untrue.
JULIE: That time with Lisa?
SCOTT: That was a misunderstanding.
JULIE: That time with Hollie?
SCOTT: That wasn't what it looked like.
---
[m64.jpg
JULIE: That time you dumped Kim for...
SCOTT: Okay Me and Kim are all good now, all right?
JULIE: Whatever! Ramona's out of your league. Let's just leave it at that. Besides, I'm not even sure she did have a big breakup. She keeps mentioning some guy named Gideon.
---
[m65.jpg
SCOTT: Yeah, I don't know what it is about that girl.
JULIE: Forget it, Scott!

#Later at his apartment, Scott receives a call from his sister.
STACEY: You're thinking of juggling two chicks?
SCOTT: Not even!
STACEY: Well, you should break up with your fake high-school girlfriend.
SCOTT: Wait, who told you?
STACEY: Wallace. Duh! You of all people should know how sucky it is to get cheated on.
SCOTT: Don't you have a job to do?
STACEY: You're right. I should send out a mass text about this. Bye.

NEIL: Whoa.
KNIVES: The Toronto International Battle of the Bands?
STEPHEN: That's right. This guy at work was like, "Steve, you know anybody in a band?" And I was like, "I'm in a band." And he was like, "You're in a band?" And I was like, "Yeah, I am totally in a band."

KNIVES: Is there a prize or something?
STEPHEN: Only a record deal with G-Man Graves.
SCOTT: Who's that?

STEPHEN: Indie producer of the millennium.

RAMONA: Uh, Scott Pilgrim?
SCOTT: Hi, I was thinking about asking you out, but then I realized how stupid that would be. So, do you want to go out sometime?
---
[m86.jpg
RAMONA: No, that's okay. You can just sign for this, all right?
SCOTT: You don't remember me, do you? We met at the party the other day.
RAMONA: Were you the Pac-Man guy?
---
[m87.jpg
SCOTT: No. Not even. That was some total ass. I was the other guy.
RAMONA: You know, you need to sign for this, whatever this is.
SCOTT: But if I sign for it, you'll leave.
RAMONA: Yeah, it's how it works.
SCOTT: Okay, well, maybe, do you wanna hang out sometime? Get to know each other? You're the new kid on the block, right? I've lived here forever, so there are reasons for you to hang out with me.
---
[m88.jpg
RAMONA: You want me to hang out with you?
SCOTT: Yeah, if that's cool.
RAMONA: If I say yes, will you sign for your damn package?

RAMONA: Oh, you assumed wrong.
---
[m91.jpg
SCOTT: So, how did you end up in Toronto?
RAMONA: Just needed to escape, I guess.
SCOTT: Yeah.
RAMONA: I got this job here, and Gideon had always said Toronto was one of the great cities, so...
SCOTT: Is Gideon your boyfriend?
RAMONA: He's a friend.
SCOTT: Was he your boyfriend?
RAMONA: Do you mind if I don't get into that right now?
SCOTT: It's so not interesting to me.
---
[m92.jpg
RAMONA: So, what about you? What do you do?
SCOTT: I'm in between jobs at the moment.
RAMONA: Between what and what?
SCOTT: Well, my last job was a long book filled with sighs.
RAMONA: I know plenty of those.
SCOTT: Is that why you left New York?
RAMONA: Pretty much. It was just time to head somewhere a little more chilled.
SCOTT: Well, it's certainly chilled here.
RAMONA: Yeah.
SCOTT: It's chilled, as in cold.
RAMONA: Yeah.
---
[m92a.jpg
RAMONA: This is ridiculous. Isn't it, like, April?
SCOTT: I know. I can barely see you. This whole thing is an unmitigated disaster. 
RAMONA: I think act of God is a pretty decent excuse for a lousy date.
SCOTT: So this is a date, eh?
RAMONA: Did I say date? Slip of the tongue.
SCOTT: Tongue.
---

SCOTT: You have seven evil ex-boyfriends?
RAMONA: Seven evil exes, yes.
SCOTT: And I have to fight...
RAMONA: Defeat.
SCOTT: Defeat your seven evil exes if we're going to continue to date?
RAMONA: Pretty much.

SCOTT: So, I invited Ramona over for dinner tonight, so you can't be here. I don't want you gaying up the place.
WALLACE: Okay, Scott. But in return, I have to issue an ultimatum.
SCOTT: One of your famous ultimatums?
---
[m184.jpg
WALLACE: It may live in infamy. You have to break up with  Knives, that poor angel, today.
---
[m185.jpg
SCOTT: But it's hard.
WALLACE: If you don't, I'm going to tell Ramona about Knives. I swear to God, Scott. Give me the bacon, and go do your dirt while I watch the Lucas Lee marathon.
SCOTT: Who's Lucas Lee?
---
[m186.jpg
WALLACE: Oh! He was this pretty good skater. Now he's this pretty good actor. He's filming a Winifred Hailey movie in Toronto right now.
SCOTT: They make movies in Toronto?
WALLACE: I'm stalking him later.

KNIVES: To meet my parents. It's my birthday dinner.
SCOTT: I think that's a really bad idea.
KNIVES: No, it's okay. Why?
SCOTT: I'm too old for you. 
KNIVES: No, you're not. My dad is nine years older than my mom.

[m233.jpg
RAMONA: You seem a little heightened.
SCOTT: Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I just sort of feel like I'm on drugs when I'm with you. Not that I do drugs, unless you do drugs, in which case I do drugs all the time. Every drug. Yeah, I don't know. Just when I'm with you, things sort of seem a little brighter.

STEPHEN: Scott, you are in, right?
RAMONA: You wanna go?
SCOTT: Well, kind of almost died back there.
RAMONA: I'm not saying I want to go.
SCOTT: Yeah. We can totally go.
RAMONA: I'll do whatever you want to do.
SCOTT: So, let's go.
---
[m382.jpg
RAMONA: We really don't have to go to this thing. It'll probably be a bad scene all around.
SCOTT: No, I'm fine. It's just...
RAMONA: It's just...
SCOTT: Well...

SCOTT: Have you ever dated someone that wasn't a total ass?
RAMONA: So far you're not a total ass.
SCOTT: But I'm part ass?
RAMONA: If it makes you feel better, you're the nicest guy I've dated.
SCOTT: Wait, is that good?
RAMONA: It's what I need right now.
SCOTT: But not later?
RAMONA: Scott, I don't have all the answers, okay? I'd just like to try to live in the moment if I can.
SCOTT: I'd just like to live.

RAMONA: Look, I know Todd was bad news, but are you saying Envy wasn't? We all have baggage.
SCOTT: Well, my baggage doesn't try and kill me every five minutes. What did you do to make your ex-boyfriend so insane?
RAMONA: Exes.
SCOTT: Whatever.
RAMONA: No breakup is painless, somebody always gets hurt. What about you and that girl, Knives? Who broke up with who?
SCOTT: I believe I broke up with her.
RAMONA: And she was cool with that?
---
[m385.jpg
SCOTT: Knives is with Young Neil now. She's totally cool with it.
RAMONA: You sure about that?
SCOTT: Yeah, she's very mature for her age. We had a very healthy breakup. We're all peaches and gravy.
KNIVES: No!

RAMONA: What about you and Kim?
SCOTT: Me and Kim? I can barely remember. It was high school. She had freckles.
RAMONA: That's it?
SCOTT: Yeah, it kind of ended. We changed.
RAMONA: That's really the whole book?
---
[m387.jpg
SCOTT: Okay, fine, I had to fight a guy to be with her. Okay? I kicked him so hard that he saw the curvature of the earth. Does that make you feel any better?
RAMONA: Well, now you are being a total ass. Welcome to the club.
SCOTT: I'm sorry. I'm not usually like this.
RAMONA: Hey, don't worry. I don't even know what I'm like anymore.

[m388.jpg
SCOTT: I think this ex-boyfriends thing is messing with my head.
RAMONA: Exes.
SCOTT: Why do you keep saying that?

RAMONA: Roxy?
SCOTT: You know her?
ROXY: Does she know me?
SCOTT: What is she talking about?
ROXY: He really doesn't know?
SCOTT: Wait.

#Scott realizes Roxy is one of Ramona's exes.
SCOTT: You and her?
RAMONA: It's just a phase.

[m396.jpg
ROXY: Just a phase?
SCOTT: You had a sexy phase?
RAMONA: It meant nothing. I didn't think it would count.
ROXY: It meant nothing?
RAMONA: I was just a little bi-curious.

[m397.jpg
ROXY: Well, honey, I'm a little bi-furious.

ROXY: Back off, hasbian. If Gideon can't have you, no one can. The League has spoken. 
---
[m407.jpg
Well, then Gideon best get his pretentious ass up here because I'm about to kick yours out of the Great White North.

RAMONA: I'd rather be dead than go back. He's a creep, you're a bitch of his.
ROXY: Give it a rest, Ramona. This is a League game.
RAMONA: Meaning?
ROXY: Meaning your precious Scott must defeat me with his own fists.

RAMONA: Her weak point is the back of her knees.
SCOTT: Wait, how does that work?
RAMONA: Whenever we were making out I would just...

RAMONA: So...
SCOTT: Two gin-and-tonics, please?
RAMONA: I thought you didn't drink.
SCOTT: Only on special occasions. Why? Did you want one?
RAMONA: Guess we really didn't know that much about each other, do we?
SCOTT: Maybe you could just give me a list of all of your exes so that I can at least know who's going to beat my ass into the ground next.
RAMONA: Maybe we could exchange our information.

[m423.jpg
SCOTT: Hey, just out of sheer curiosity and concern for my mortal well-being, is there anyone at this party that you haven't slept with?
RAMONA: I think we should split.
SCOTT: As in get out of here, or as in split, split?
RAMONA: I'd hope you could figure that out. Or did you miss the part where I saved your ass.
SCOTT: How could I? I feel like we just washed our sexy laundry in public.
RAMONA: Dirty laundry. You're drunk.
---
[m424.jpg
SCOTT: I had, like, one drink.
---
[m425.jpg
RAMONA: I'm sorry I cared. I don't enjoy all this, Scott. In fact, I'm sick of it. I thought you might be more understanding.
SCOTT: I just...
RAMONA: You're just another evil ex waiting to happen.

RAMONA: P.S. Here's your stupid list.
SCOTT: Matthew Patel, Lucas Lee, Todd Ingram, Roxy Richter. Who the hell are the Katayanagi Twins?
STEPHEN: Oh! You don't know?
