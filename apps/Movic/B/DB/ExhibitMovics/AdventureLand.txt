#The year is 1987
JAMES: Hey, you want to get out here?
GIRL: What a rager, huh?
JAMES: Yeah. Yeah. Isn't it weird that all this, this all happened at the end of the semester? You and me.

[m2.jpg
GIRL: James... I don't think I can see you anymore.
JAMES: You don't... What do you mean?
GIRL: Sorry.

ERIC: Women are mercurial, man.

[m5.jpg
FRIEND: And you did just start dating last week.
JAMES: It was 11 days ago.
ERIC: You didn't tell her about the Scarlet V, did you?
JAMES: That has nothing to do with it.
ERIC: Oh, Christ. Brennan.
JAMES: What?
ERIC: You did! You promised me!
JAMES: I don't lie to people who I care about.
ERIC: Yes, but you could've just left it out of the narrative. You know? You don't want "virgin" to be your signifier.
---
[m6.jpg
JAMES: He takes one semiotics class, and I'm supposed to...
FRIEND: Here, drink up.
---
[m7.jpg
ERIC: Well, you know what, we'll find you a girl, all right? When we're on the Continent.
---
[m8.jpg
FRIEND: Here's to sexually-permissive cultures!
ERIC: Yes! Focus on Europe. It's going to be a transformative experience.

#At graduation party.
ALL: To the graduates.

[m10.jpg
#James' father drinks an old-fashioned.
JAMES: Yeah, so I researched some more youth hostels, and the median cost is jut a little higher than I expected, about $7.68 more, multiplied by the 42 days is $322.56.
---
[m11.jpg
MOM: Bill, do you want to take this?
DAD: Execuse me, can you get me a refill here? That's an old-fashioned.
---
[m12.jpg
JAMES: So with the $368 I have from Grandpa's trust fund, plus the $900 you guys are already giving me, thank you, I do need an additional $279.11.
---
[m13.jpg
MOM: James, we didn't want to spoil your graduation, but your father has been transferred to a different department.
JAMES: Really? Is that... Is that bad?
---
[m14.jpg
MOM: Yes, we're making less, considerably less.
JAMES: 'Cause this trip was my graduation present, so...
MOM: Sweetie, I am so sorry about this trip, but I'm afraid we just can't afford it.
---
[m15.jpg
JAMES: You could still help me with rent next year, right?
MOM: All right, James, you're not listening to me.
---
[m16.jpg
WAITRESS: Here you go, sir.
DAD: There we go. Thank you very much.
DAD: (Clears throat) Listen, here's to you, kiddo. Happy graduation.
---
[m17.jpg
JAMES: Wait. What am I going to do about grad school? You know, Columbia's holding a spot for me.
MOM: Well, if you end up deciding that's what you want to do, then obviously you're going to have to get a job.
JAMES: A summer job?
===
---
[m18.jpg
ERIC: Summer in Pittsburgh. That's harsh.
JAMES: It's a nightmare. They don't like people like me where I'm from. You know, we're romantics. I read poetry for pleasure, sometimes.
ERIC: Hey, yeah, well, you know what, don't worry about it, all right?
---
[m19.jpg
ERIC: You know, with my dad's connections, we'll get a great deal on an apartment. And, hey, I'll float you for the first few months.
JAMES: Yeah?
ERIC: Yeah.
JAMES: Thank you so much, Eric.
ERIC: Hey, don't worry about it.

#Eric ready to light up weed.
ERIC: What the hell are you doing? Our parents are right over...
JAMES: What, them? They're clueless
---
[m21.jpg 
---
[m22.jpg
ERIC: This is good weed. Speaking of which, I just want you to know that you'll be with me in spirit this summer.
JAMES: Put that away. No.
ERIC: Take it.
JAMES: No.
ERIC: Take it
JAMES: No. Okay.
ERIC: Look, James, I know things suck right now, all right? But look at it this way, in a few short months, you'll be with me, in New York City, the greatest city in the world!
---
[m23.jpg
ERIC: Like we always talked about, man. Living the adventure together. Quit worrying, Brennan. That's what the weed is for.

[m27.jpg
#He sees his childhood friend Frigo riding a bike.
---
[m28.jpg
#James starts job hunting
JAMES: I really haven't had that many jobs, per se, but here are my academic records and my extracurricular activities. I wrote for The Gordian Knot, it was a literary journal in college. And in math, I got 770 on the SATs, so I assume I'd be good at tabulating checks.
---
[m29.jpg
MANAGER: These are the only jobs you've ever had?
JAMES: No, no, I also spent several years taking care of a neighbor's lawn, the Palmieris. I have a their letter of recommendation here.
MANAGER: All right. Fill this out. I'll call you if anything comes up.
---
[m30.jpg
JAMES: No, I've never actually driven an asphalt mixer, per se, but I did once drive my friend's van to Wisconsin on a pretty lengthy road trip.
---
[m31.jpg
JAMES: Yeah, so... Okay, is there any way I can take a lesson... They hung up.
---
[m32.jpg
JAMES: What am I supposed to do? I'm not even qualified for manual labor. The only place I know I can get a job is with Frigo.
MOM: What, at Adventureland? You got a concussion on the teacup ride there when you were six.
DAD: You can do better, kiddo.
JAMES: No, there's nothing. I majored in Comparative Literature and Renaissance Studies. Unless someone nees help restoring a fresco, I'm screwed.

RADIO: Paulette? Come in, Paulette?
PAULLET: I'm sorry. Bobby?
RADIO: Paulette? Come in, Paulette?
BOBBY: You just... You gotta press it.
PAULLET: Oh, they are gone. This is James, and he's applying for a games job.
---
[m36.jpg
BOBBY: Games! Oh, all right, good. Let's get you set up.
JAMES: Acutally, Bobby, I'd prefer a rides job, if it's still open. You look more like a games guy, plus I've already got out the games application, so... All right?
---
[m37.jpg
BOBBY: Okay, rule. No freebies, no free turns for your friends, no free upgrades, no free food.
JAMES: So, just nothing is free here.
BOBBY: Everybody has to pay for everything. And more importantly, working in games, no one ever wins a giant-ass panda.
---
[m38.jpg
PAULLET: Yeah, we don't have that many left.
BOBBY: Cool? Can you hand me a T-shirt, please?
JAMES: Here, I have a resume. I don't know if you still want to take a look at it.
---
[m39.jpg
BOBBY: James? Am I pronouncing that right? James?
JAMES: Yeah.
BOBBY: Okay, by accepting this T-shirt, you are...
PAULLET: Hired!
BOBBY: Well, usually I... More of a ceremonial thing, the T-shirt.
PAULLET: Sorry.
===
---
[m40.jpg
JOEL: Okay, new guy, let's get this over with.
---
[m41.jpg
JOEL: Here we are at the first of many games. This one is inexplicably called The Flighing Dutchman. Even more inexplicable is how they decided to spell it.
---
[m42.jpg
JOEL: One dollar to buy five rings. If one of the rings lands on one of the red bottles, they win a giant-ass pand.
JAMES: That is a giant-ass pand.
JOEL: Yeah, it's the best prize in the park. That's because this game is un-winnable.
---
[m43.jpg
JOEL: Observe. I'll drop a ring from three inches away.
JAMES: So nobody ever wins?
JOEL: If someoen wins a giant-ass panda on your watch, you should just go home because you're fired, okay?
---
[m44.jpg
JOEL: So the object of the game is to knock the hat off the dummy with a softball, except, as you'll see, half the hats are glued on.
JAMES: Really?
JOEL: Yeah. I mean, we pay little Malaysian kids 10 cents a day to make these toys, we can't just give them away.
---
[m45.jpg
JOEL: You get a five-minute bathroom break every two hours.
---
[m46.jpg
FRIGO: Brennan, they got you working on games?
JOEL: You know Frigo?
JAMES: Yeah. He used to be my best friend. Then I turned four.
---
[m47.jpg
JOEL: So if you stand directly below the hoop, you will see that it's been hammered into an oval shape. But from back there, the sucker just can't tell.
JAMES: Jesus, that's so wrong.
JOEL: A criminal abuse of the laws of perspective.
JAMES: Yeah, well, people are getting ripped off.
---
[m48.jpg
JOEL: Yeah, yeah, Trotsky, let's get you a booth. So your life must be utter mess, or you wouldn't be here.
JAMES: I was supposed to go to Europe, but my family has money problems.
JOEL: Wait till your parents start making you pay rent. My dad even makes me pay utilities.

[m52.jpg
BOBBY: Hey James?
JAMES: Yeah?
BOBBY: You think you can maybe, you know, take it up a notch?
JAMES: Yeah, I know. Maybe I'm not the right guy to run this game. I really... I think I should probably be on the rides department.
---
[m53.jpg
BOBBY: No. No, no, no. You're more of a game guy.
PAULLET: You're very gamey.
JAMES: Yeah. yeah.
---
[m54.jpg
BOBBY: Have you ever seen a horse race before? Have you ever, like, heard one on the radio?
JAMES: Harness racing or, like, the normal kind?
PAULLET: That's a good question.
BOBBY: It doesn't matter. Look, the Kentucky Derby. Have you seen the Kentucky Derby? The way they annouce it on the radio, and it's really...
---
[m55.jpg
BOBBY: So get into it. Make it a show. Make it a performance. You know what I mean? That's what people come for. So let's take it to a 10. All right, got faith in you, man.
JAMES: Thank you.
PAULLET: "Take it to a 10." I like that.
---
[m56.jpg
#Another game begins. James announces the race play by play.
JAMES: Ladies and gentlemen, put down your mint juleps. Horses are all at the starting gate. Okay, and they're off! And Red bolts out of the gate, taking an early lead! 
---
[m57.jpg
JAMES: But look out! Here comes Green, issuing a challenge from the outside lane. Green runs well on a muddy track, folks, so today's conditions give him a slight edge.
---
[m58.jpg
JAMES: And Yellow is dead last! What a disappointment after Yellow's strong showing at Saratoga last spring.
---
[m59.jpg
JAMES: Wait! Look out! Wait a second! Out of nowhere, Ornage breaks ahead of the pack, and now, in the back stretch, Orange and Green. Orange and Green, and Orange takes it by a nose!
---
[m60.jpg
JAMES: Green places and Red shows. Please come to the window to collect your winnings!
CUSTOMER: What window? There's a window?
JAMES: No. No, there's not. Here you go. Congratulations, sir.

#A new day.
MAN1: Yo! Guy!
JAMES: Yeah?
MAN1: Give me five. Hey, I heard some big fat lady fell of the Paratrooper.
JAMES: Oh, really? I didn't hear about that. Was she okay?
---
[m67.jpg
---
[m68.jpg
MAN1: I don't know. Hey, you know what? Give me 10. You know what? Make it 15. Yeah, I heard she was this big, fat, slob of a woman, you know?
---
[m69.jpg
MAN2: Hey, he won! Check it out! Way to go, Dom! Way to go!
---
[m70.jpg
JAMES: Okay, sir, actually, I saw you holding him over the bottles. That's cheating.
MAN2: Oh, no. He won fair-and-square, sir. You know, you gotta give him a prize!
MAN1: Yeah, I saw him throw it!
MAN2: Hey, thank you, sir.
JAMES: Guys, hey, fellas, I could lose my job.
---
[m71.jpg
#Em wonders what's going on.
MAN1: This guy's trying to rip off a kid!

#The man shows his knife.
MAN2: Why don't you give the kid a panda.
---
[m73.jpg
EM: Here you go, here's your panda.
MAN2: Yeah, thanks. Here you go, Dom. I mean, he's just a little kid.
---
[m74.jpg
JAMES: Look, am I gonna get in trouble? No one's ever supposed to lose a giant-ass panda.
EM: Is it worth getting knifed over?
JAMES: No. Hi. I'm James Brennan. I just started.
EM: Em. Nice to meet you. Sucks you're gonna lose your job your second day, James.
JAMES: No. I need this job.
EM: (Laughs) I'm kidding. You're okay. I'll tell Bobby you lost the panda at knifepoint.

EM: You guys want some of this? I bagged it from Paulette. Cuban rum?
JAMES: Thanks.

JAMES: No, I don't know about them.
FRIGO: Time out, guys. Guys, he doesn't know the legend.
MUNCH: Connell once jammed with Lou Reed.
JAMES: Really? So Connell's like a real musician?
FRIGO: Yeah, he's got his own band. It's frigging awesome.

EM: Here, have some rum.
JAMES: Thanks. My mother. She's very nosy. Yeah, she used to read my journals. I had to start writing them in Italian. I took Italian for a year. I went through an opera...
---
[m85.jpg
EM: So, Joel told me you're gonna go to Columbia for grad school.
JAMES: Yeah.
EM: Wow. I'm at NYU right now.
JAMES: Oh, really? Oh, that's cool. Maybe I'll run into you on the streets of NYC.
---
[m86.jpg
EM: What are you studying?
JAMES: Journalism. Yeah, I want to be, like, a travel essayist. But I want to report on the real state of the world. You know, like Charles Dickens, for example, wrote what you might call travel book, but he visited prisons and mental asylums.
---
[m87.jpg
EM: That's cool.
JAMES: Yeah, is it?
EM: Yeah.
JAMES: Okay.
EM: But why do you have to go to grad school for that?
---
[m88.jpg
#James is surprised that Em is really listening.
JAMES: No, that's a valid question, but, actually, journalism is kind of like this old boys' network still. You need the right connections. It's very Ivy League, very exclusive. Stupid. I think my mother would rather I intern at some Fortune 500 company or something like that.
---
[m89.jpg
EM: F that, right?
JAMES: Yeah.

CONNELL: I'll tell you about it sometime.
JAMES: So, where does your band play?
CONNELL: Usual places around town. I need better musicians. I'm starting a new band out in LA.

CONNELL: Yeah. It's going to be cool. Going this winter.

EM: Well, you know, my dad's a lawyer. It's been his life-long dream for his daughter to work at Adventureland.
JAMES: High hopes.
EM: Also gets me out of the house.

JAMES: Okay. Is anybody else coming in here, or is it just us?
EM: Do you have any more of that pot?
JAMES: Yeah, at home. Why?
EM: We should make pot cookies. That would be so fun. Have you done that?
JAMES: I have not. I've had cookies.
---
[m105.jpg
EM: My connections have all dried up. That's why I'm asking.
JAMES: Your connections have dried up? What, you think, I have ties to the underworld or something? I have five joints. You think I can, like, put a hit out on somebody?
EM: I'm gonna get a drink. You want one?

EM: Coming?
JAMES: Yeah, I'll meet you inside.

LISA: Hey, Joel.
JOEL: So, I didn't expect you to be back here.
LISA: Oh, man, I had my whole summer, like, mapped out. Laying out by the pool by day, dancing by night.
---
[m118.jpg
LISA: But my dad got injured on the job, and he's laid up, so I got to help out.
---
[m119.jpg
LISA: Well, I gotta go run the Musik-Express. I don't want Paulette bitching me out on my first day. I'm Lisa.
JAMES: James.
LISA: I heard you lost a giant-ass pand at knifepoint.
JAMES: Did you? I guess my legend precedes me.
LISA: What?
JAMES: It was nice to meet you.
LISA: Nice to meet you, too, James.

#Later
JAMES: Hey.
EM: Hey.
JAMES: Hey, I made you a tape. 
---
[m124.jpg
JAMES: These are my favorite bummer songs. They're truly miserable, pit-of-despair type songs. I think you'll love it.
EM: Cool.
JAMES: Yeah. Hey, you want to get a drink or something?
EM: Sure.
---
[m125.jpg
===
---
[m126.jpg
JAMES: Hey, I feel like I should tell you.
EM: Tell me what?
JAMES: Yeah. I had my heart broken recently. Is that... I don't know, I just thought I should tell you.
EM: That sucks.
JAMES: Yeah.
---
[m127.jpg
EM: Who broke your heart?
JAMES: A girl at school. Yeah, it's typical. I actually... I think there was... I think there was something there. I think that we actually had, like, potential. I don't know. I think she was afraid.
EM: Afraid of what?
JAMES: I don't know. Afraid of it being good or something.
---
[m128.jpg
EM: Was the sex good?
JAMES: She was very sexy.
EM: You've been with a lot of girls?
JAMES: Yep. Are we talking about, like, intercourse specifically?
EM: (Laughs) Yeah.
---
[m129.jpg
JAMES: Yeah, yeah. No, in that case, there were actually a few times that I... Yeah, a few times I could've done that. But it wasn't... It wasn't exactly right.
EM: Wait, so you're telling me you're a virgin?
JAMES: There were circumstances...
---
[m130.jpg
EM: Oh, my God!
JAMES: Okay, all right, for example, junior year, I was dating this girl, Betsy Cooke. Betsy was kind of, like... She was kind of a prude, actually. Anyway, one day, I was reading Shakespeare and I realized I don't really love this person. You know? 
---
[m131.jpg
JAMES: It was one of the sonnets. "Being your slave, what should I do but tend upon the hours and times of your desires?" And I realized I don't want to tend to Betsy's hours or her times. All right, that doesn't matter. 
---
[m132.jpg
JAMES: Anyway, I drove to Betsy's house, and I was literally about to tell her, and that's the night she said she wanted to have sex. Can you believe it? It was the same... You know, it was the same night, so... So what about you and intercourse?
---
[m133.jpg
EM: Can you stop saying "intercourse"?
JAMES: Sure, sure.
EM: I don't know. There were guys in high school, and then, like, there were other ones.
---
[m134.jpg
JAMES: Were you in love with any of them?
EM: No, Hell no.
---
[m135.jpg
JAMES: Got you. Oh, hey, it's Connell. Hey, Connell!
CONNELL: Jimbo.
JAMES: Hey, you know this place?
CONNELL: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Everybody knows this is my joint.

CONNELL: These guys work at the park. This is Ronnie.
JAMES: Nice to meet you.
RONNIE: Hi.
EM: Hey.
---
[m137.jpg
CONNELL: We're gonna go meet some friends in the back.
JAMES: Is that Connell's wife? She's, like, really pretty.
---
[m138.jpg
EM: Yeah, she is. She works at that lame disco, Razzmatazz. It's kind of sad.
JAMES: Oh, yeah? I've never been there.
EM: No, I mean their marriage is sad. He didn't want it. Now he's trapped.

EM: Yeah, I just needed some air.

CONNELL: I hope you didn't tell her that.
JAMES: Why?
CONNELL: You told her that, didn't you? James, no girl wants to hear about some other chick you're hard up for.
JAMES: Right. They don't?
CONNELL: They don't.

CONNELL: Look, I'm not saying never be vulnerable with a girl. I'm just saying don't play that card first.
JAMES: Wait, it's a card? Like a card?
CONNELL: There's a science to it. You're probably pretty good at science.

JOEL: Okay, observe. Two options. I can play it safe, pick them off from back here, or I can rush into the breach, guns a-blazing. Make a run right at the cortex, and bombs away.

JAMES: So, how's your dad?
LISA: Since he can't work, he's been so fucked up. Yeah. Stays in bed a lot. Won't see anyone.
JAMES: Men are prideful creatures.
LISA: Exactly. Do you believe in God?
JAMES: Wow, theology doesn't come up a lot around here.
LISA: Yeah, but you see someone you love in pain, you sort of think about that kind of stuff.

JAMES: I believe in love. I mean, I think love is very transfermable. I think that love makes things transform together.

LISA: (Laughing) I'm majorly high.
JAMES: Oh. Yeah, me, too.
