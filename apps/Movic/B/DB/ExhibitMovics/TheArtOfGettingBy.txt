GEORGE: Since the dawn of recorded history, something like 110 billion human beings have been born into this world. And not a single one of them made it. 
---
[m2.jpg
GEORGE: There are 6.8 billion people on the planet. Roughly 60 million of them die every year. 60 million people. That comes out to about 160,000 per day.
---
[m3.jpg
GEORGE: I read this quote once when I was a kid, "We live alone, we die alone. Everything else is just an illusion." It used to keep me up at night. We all die alone.
---
[m4.jpg
GEORGE: So, why am I supposed to spend my life working, sweating, struggling? For an illusion?
---
[m5.jpg
GEORGE: Because no amount of friends, no girl, no assignments about conjugating the pluperfect or determining the square root of the hypotenuse is gonna help me avoid my fate.

TEACHER: Do you have your work, George?
GEORGE: No.
TEACHER: Why not?
GEORGE: I was depressed.
TEACHER: Oh, yes? Why was that?
---
[m10.jpg
GEORGE: Because I realized I'm gonna die one day.
TEACHER: We're all gonna die one day, George. I don't think that's a reasonable excuse for not completing your trigonometry exercise.
GEORGE: Well, I was trying to. I just couldn't shake this awareness of my mortality. Everything seemed meaningless, including the assignment, unfortunately.
TEACHER: I want you to go to the principal's office and find meaning in the homework. Bring it to me completed by the end of the period.

TEACHER: You better go.

GEORGE: Bill.
PRINCIPAL: Even though you have off-campus privileges as a senior, if you are seen anywhere in the city smoking, you have your privileges revoked. Automatic probation.
GEORGE: Why are you telling me?
PRINCIPAL: You think I can't smell?
GEORGE: You can smell all you want.
---
[m15.jpg
GEORGE: Shall we get down to business?
PRINCIPAL: George, if you keep performing the way you are, forget about college, forget about graduating, even. So, this counts as your official warning. Suspension is next.
GEORGE: I thought probation was next.
PRINCIPAL: Don't play the angles, George. They won't work. Neither do jokes.
GEORGE: I wasn't joking. 
---
[m16.jpg
PRINCIPAL: I know you are capable.
GEORGE: I have a real problem with motivating. But I think I can do it. I'll try.
PRINCIPAL: All right, go. And don't make me regret it.

#A teacher comes to the rooftop. Sally throws away her cigarette and slips away as George deliberately attracts the teacher's attension by showing his cigarette.
TEACHER: Who's smoking up here? George, what do you think you're doing?
GEORGE: I was having a tough day. I guess the stress finally got to me, Mrs Dougherty.
TEACHER: George, why do you do these things? Now, what do you mean by stress.

MOM: Hi
GEORGE: Hi.
MOM: I got an email from your school.
GEORGE: Jesus.
MOM: Some kind of academic probation? Can I help you? Can I get you a tutor or a private college advisor? If you don't get into a decent school, then I don't know how you gonna get a job.
GEORGE: I have it under control.
MOM: Honey, if you don't get into a decent college...
GEORGE: I am gonna watch TV...
MOM: No, you will not watch TV. You will stay here till we can come up with a plan for getting you into college.

GEORGE: I don't have a subject, Harris.
TEACHER: Why the heck not?
GEORGE: I don't know.
TEACHER: George, you're going to have to start digging around in there, so you can develop that talent of yours, to express that beautiful heart of yours. So figure out what you want to say, and say it.

GEORGE: Hey.
SALLY: I'm Sally.
GEORGE: I know. 
---
[m29.jpg
SALLY: Thanks for covering for me. Why did you?
GEORGE: I don't know. You were doing something so renegade, I think you deserve to get away with it. I run afoul of the authorities so often, I figured I could handle it better than you.
SALLY: You are really weird. 
---
[m30.jpg
SALLY: So why don't you ever do your work.
GEORGE: There are so many more important things to think about. Homework ends up seeming like an afterthought.
SALLY: ADD?
GEORGE: No, they tried everything. Ritalin, Lexapro, tutors, therapy. Nothing worked. I'm the Teflon slacker. It's more like we're living in a dying time, you know? I mean, you got global warming, wars, terrorism, tsnamis.
SALLY: Okay...
GEORGE: We're definitely on the downhill side. So, what are we working towards? What's the point?
SALLY: I thought I had fears, but they're pretty run-of-the-mill. Pain, death.
GEORGE: Oh, not me. I fear life.
---
[m31.jpg
SALLY: Do you have any friends, George?
GEORGE: I'm kind of a misanthrope. Not a choice, just a fact.
---
[m32.jpg
SALLY: You wanna come up?
===
---
[m33.jpg
GEORGE: How did you end up in New York?
SALLY: My mom had me when she was 16. My dad was a truck driver, and one day he took off and never came back.
GEORGE: And this was?
SALLY: Clarksburg. It's a small town in Tennessee. This rich guy from New York, who owned a textile plant, started coming down, and it was like we were castaways and he was the ship. But I ended up here, 8 years old, new school, new friends, fancy new clothes. My mom divorced him a year ago and now she's back on the singles scene with a vengeance.
---
[m34.jpg
SALLY: I do think I should get some homework done though.
GEORGE: I should get going then. Got work to do myself.
SALLY: Yeah, right.

MOM: Hi, sweetie. We got take-out from the rotisserie chicken place.
JACK: Grab a plate and join us.
GEORGE: But the lights, What happened?
MOM: It's my fault. I forgot to pay the bill. And it's no big deal. They'll be on tomorrow.

[m38.jpg
JACK: George, we're trying to turn this awkward little mix-ip into a fun experience. And if you can't get into the spirit of adventure, then you can just do your own thing. You don't have to stick around.
GEORGE: I'm sorry, Jack. I can't use my laptop, much less get my assignments.
JACK: So, go to the library or Starbucks. Be resourceful.

TEACHER: Does anyone have any ideas about which elements of the novel pinpoint it as part of the Romantic movement? Any one? George?
---
[m43.jpg
TEACHER: George? 
GEORGE: Yeah?
TEACHER: I was asking what conclusion you came to in the exercise we're doing.
---
[m44.jpg
GEORGE: Sorry. About what, again?
TEACHER: About which elements of the novel pinpoint it as part of the Romantic movement?
---
[m45.jpg
GEORGE: Which novel?
TEACHER: The Mayor of Casterbrige, George, which, obviously, you didn't read.
---
[m46.jpg
GEORGE: I loved it.
TEACHER: Clearly. Anyone else?
GEORGE: My favorite part of the book is how the town's layout is described from the perspective of a bee traveling from one side of town to the other. It's so visual. So, I guess what Hardy's doing is aligning his point of view not with an all-seeing God but with an insect, the tiniest, humblest creature in nature. Which is pretty Romantic.

WILL: Dude, what are you always drawing? He's like the mad artist, just hunched over his books. He never listens to a word the teacher says.
SALLY: What, like you do?
WILL: Can I see some of the stuff you draw?
GEORGE: Yeah, sure.
---
[m52.jpg
SALLY: You have issues.
WILL: No. Dude, you're sensitive. The sensitive artiste. Could you draw something like this for one of my parties? I'm throwing a huge one at my brother's club on New Year's Eve.
GEORGE: You serious?
WILL: You know, we can blow it up, make it a poster, invites, flyers.
SALLY: Yeah, that'd be great, right?

GEORGE: Rule number one of cutting school.
SALLY: I've cut school before.
GEORGE: To shop. Rule number one, cutting school is fun.
SALLY: That's a rule?
GEORGE: Rule number two, cut rarely to preserve the specialness.
SALLY: Is that even a word?
GEORGE: Rule number three, do something culturally rewarding with your time to earn it morally.

SALLY: Let's follow him.
---
[m65.jpg
SALLY: What do you think he's doing?
GEORGE: Probably just going to a meeting.
SALLY: I bet it's a lovers' rendezvous. My stepfather cheated all the time.
GEORGE: Maybe.
SALLY: No offense, but he looks kind of creepy.

GEORGE: What's wrong with them.
PRINCIPAL: Nothing. But they have an easier time of getting by than you do. You're not exactly hooking up with a study group.

PRINCIPAL: Hey, I have something for you. Career Day is coming up in a few weeks, and we always assign an exemplary student to represent Morgan to the alumni speakers. You know, to act as a liaison, escort them to the classroom, whatever...
GEORGE: You have really lost it.
PRINCIPAL: Then there is that matter that Mrs. Dougherty broached to me.
GEORGE: The substitue?
PRINCIPAL: Yeah. Smoking on campus is automatic suspension.
---

DUSTINE: My name is Dustine Heath. I'm a student. I was a student here. I was in the class with that terrifying old man over there.
---
[m77.jpg
---
[m78.jpg
DUSTINE: Yeah, I'm an artist. Honestly, I don't know what I am doing here. Was a little hungover when they called me and asked me to do this and I said yes just to get them off the phone. I got the schedule in the mail several days later and I was a little embarrassed. I'm not really established or anything.
---
[m79.jpg
DUSTINE: I had my first art show a year ago, which was good. Got me this coat.

DUSTINE: Well, let me show you some of my work here. I don't know, sometimes people look at your stuff and, you know, they think it's really interesting or they think it's bullshit, and I don't know the difference. I honestly don't. You just, you know, hope not to be fooling yourself, I guess.

DUSTINE: It felt like Nagasaki in there.
GEORGE: You were great.
---
[m84.jpg
DUSTINE: Thanks, man. Do you paint?
GEORGE: Yeah, I'd like to. I just don't know what to paint.
DUSTINE: Yeah, well, it's the hardest part, you know?
---
[m85.jpg
GEORGE: Does that makes me not a painter?
---
[m86.jpg
DUSTINE: The fact that you struggle with it is a really good thing. But how can you call yourself a painter if you don't paint? You like Morgan?
GEORGE: Not really. I have no idea what I'm doing here.
DUSTINE: I don't think anybody does, George. At least you admit it. If you want, you can come to my studio in Brooklyn and check some stuff out.

DUSTINE: They're all kind of different, you know? Each one goes through its own little process of death and rebirth. That one literally took me two hours.
SALLY: You live here, too?
DUSTINE: Mm-hmm.
SALLY: It's so simple.
DUSTINE: It's not about comfort, really, you know? You... How old are you?
SALLY: 18.
DUSTINE: (Chuckling) No.
---
[m94.jpg
GEORGE: Every time I think about a subject, or even try to visualize an image of what I think I should paint, I just feel like I'm full of it, like I'm trying to be something I'm not. 
DUSTINE: George, this is who you are. This stuff is wonderful, man. It really is. It's fantastic.
GEORGE: Really? No, they're just doodles, you know, immature stuff.
DUSTINE: No, man. This is what you should be painting. At least until you evolve into something else, you know what I mean? But you gotta exercise the muscle, even if you're not feeling it, you know what I mean? You just... You gotta do it or else it'll never happen.
---
[m95.jpg
DUSTINE: Well, you guys are together, right?
GEORGE: No.
DUSTINE: I'm sorry. That was stupid. I shouldn't have said anything.
GEORGE: No, not all. We're not together.
DUSTINE: You like her. You should like her, if you don't. I'll leave that alone.

SALLY: That was so cool.
GEORGE: Uh-huh.
SALLY: I mean, he's amazing. Really talented. Don't you think?
GEORGE: A little derivative. I'm not sure he's the real deal.
SALLY: Really? He seemed like it to me.
