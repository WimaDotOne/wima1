MAN: You look like you need another.

[m010.jpg
KATE: What are you, psychic?
MAN: Look deep into my eyes.

[m011.jpg
MAN: Yeah. You're feeling very thirsty.
KATE: Oh, you are very good.
MAN: And... Oh, yeah, this is your favorite song.
---
[m012.jpg
KATE: That was so psychic.
MAN: No, that was you playing it four times in a row.
KATE: Well, love me, love George Michael. We're kindred spirits
---
[m013.jpg
MAN: How so?
KATE: We're both singers. Uh, we're both famously misunderstood and underappreciated in our time. All that's gonna change, 'cause tomorrow I've got a big audition for the West End.
---
[m014.jpg
MAN: And you, uh, came into town for it?
KATE: No, I, uh, moved out on my flatmate today.
MAN: So, what, you're gonna move back home?
KATE: Oh, kill me now.
MAN: Uh-oh. Family issues.
KATE: Yeah. Let me count the ways. Uh, anger, shame, resentment, embarrassment. And that's just my mum. Do you want to hear about my sister?
MAN: No.
---
[m015.jpg
MAN: Okay, so what's your plan?
KATE: I'll figure it out, you know. It'll be fine. Something will turn up.
MAN: Or someone.

MAN: Morning, gorgeous.
KATE: This bed, it's like sleeping on a pile of kittens. If that thought's comfortable and not completely horrifying.

[m017.jpg
MAN: I'm gonna dash down the street. I need some ginger root, fresh beets, for my famous breakfast power juice.
KATE: Cool.

[m018.jpg
MAN: And a cappuccino while you wait.
KATE: Wow.
MAN: And lashing of hot water if you fancy a shower.
KATE: Bliss.
MAN: I'll be right back.

KATE: I'm the... plumber.
WOMAN: The plumber?

[m024.jpg
KATE: Look, this isn't what it looks like. I needed a bed for the night, and he...
WOMAN: Ed.
KATE: Ed was just so understanding. I have gobs of issues, all right? Accommodation, because I've run out of options because I've really messed up for a number of reasons.
---
[m025.jpg
KATE: And he...
WOMAN: Ed.
KATE: Ed just seemed to get that.
WOMAN: Did you shag him?

[m043.jpg
SANTA: You are never early. What are you up to?
KATE: Accommodation issues.
SANTA: Mm. So the usual. What did you do this time? Fry someone's fish?
---
[m044.jpg
KATE: No. No, that was last week.
---
[m045.jpg
SANTA: You are going to run out of friends with sofas. You have been sick. You need to take care of yourself better.
KATE: Santa, I didn't know you cared.
SANTA: I don't care. I just don't want you to drop dead in front of the customers. I don't have enough tinsel to cover your corpse. Get to work, Elf.

[m046a.jpg
CUSTOMER: I don't know. You're gonna have to help me decide. They are both so darling.
KATE: I tell you what. Let's pretend Mary had twins, and you can get both.

KATE: Oh, yeah, and a lot more to come.

[m047.jpg,m048.jpg
CUSTOMER: But this one? Look at him. He's more like my idea of...

CUSTOMER: Santa? Are you there?

[m054.jpg
SISTER: Mum needs you to ring her. Every time she contacts you and gets no response, she contacts me. Yesterday, 17 times. Just do it.
KATE: Oh, don't just stand there issuing commands. I am an adult.
SISTER: You're the furthest thing from an adult that I know.
---
[m055.jpg
KATE: I need time to myself.
SISTER: I'm asking you to do a single thing, Katarina.
KATE: It's "Kate"
SISTER: Whatever. Just ring her. Contact her.
KATE: Give me one good reason.

[m056.jpg
SISTER: You've missed five doctor's appointments. You've got one tomorrow, which you know. You have to be there. She's also planning a dinner to celebrate my promotion. And you not ringing her is seriously affecting my life.

KATE: Will you be inviting Alba to the dinner?
SISTER: Just ring your mother.
KATE: Christ.

Kate: Jenna, it's me. Listen, darling, I'm sorry to leave this message. I just really need a bed for the night. Even possibly a few nights. You're my bestie. Please. I know. Just...

SANTA: Hey, Elf! This is my elf. Sant has elves, you know. Little helpers.

[m060.jpg
SANTA: I have nicknamed her "Lazy the Elf" because she appears never to work.

[m075.jpg
TOM: Look. There. You see it?
---
[m076.jpg
KATE: Ah.
TOM: Just above the lip of the roof there.

[m081.jpg
SANTA: Where have you been?
KATE: Oh. A shitting bird just shat in my eye.
---
[m082.jpg
SANTA: Is there a bird in here?
KATE: No. Some bloke was outside the shop playing silly buggers.
SANTA: Maybe you can focus your attention on the silly buggers inside the shop.

[m098.jpg
KATE: Oh, that's my luck, going for a stroll with you?
TOM: Might be.
KATE: Look, did you find me on Swiper?
TOM: Swiper?
KATE: Yeah. The modern dating application you might have heard of.
TOM: Oh. So not.

[m099.jpg
KATE: To be honest, you're not really my type.
TOM: To be honest, you're not really mine.
KATE: Well, maybe we should just leave it then.

[m100.jpg
TOM: I do like a challenge though.
---
[m101.jpg
KATE: You considered BASE jumping? Japanese blowfish?
TOM: No, I have. But right now I'm considering a stroll with you.
KATE: Consider away, because it's a no.
---
[m102.jpg
TOM: Is there anything I could improve upon to, say, persuade you?
---
[m103.jpg
KATE: No.
---
[m104.jpg
TOM: Any reason in particular?
KATE: Because you're weird, this is weird, and I don't know you.

KATE: So, please, could you just leave, okay? Shoo. Just go. Just go.
TOM: Hold on. This is weird?

TOM: Weirder than Grabber or Swiper or whatever it's called?
KATE: Yeah
