MAN: Yeah. You're feeling very thirsty.
KATE: Oh, you are very good.
MAN: And... Oh, yeah, this is your favorite song.

KATE: That was so psychic.
MAN: No, that was you playing it four times in a row.
KATE: Well, love me, love George Michael. We're kindred spirits

[m013.jpg
MAN: How so?
KATE: We're both singers. Uh, we're both famously misunderstood and underappreciated in our time. All that's gonna change, 'cause tomorrow I've got a big audition for the West End.

MAN: And you, uh, came into town for it?
KATE: No, I, uh, moved out on my flatmate today.
MAN: So, what, you're gonna move back home?
KATE: Oh, kill me now.
MAN: Uh-oh. Family issues.
KATE: Yeah. Let me count the ways. Uh, anger, shame, resentment, embarrassment. And that's just my mum. Do you want to hear about my sister?
MAN: No.

[m015.jpg
MAN: Okay, so what's your plan?
KATE: I'll figure it out, you know. It'll be fine. Something will turn up.
MAN: Or someone.

KATE: Look, this isn't what it looks like. I needed a bed for the night, and he...
WOMAN: Ed.
KATE: Ed was just so understanding. I have gobs of issues, all right? Accommodation, because I've run out of options because I've really messed up for a number of reasons.
